Previous_conversations_summary: Summary of what happened previously, especially user-provided personal information, and record it. The summary needs to be precise, concrete, and related to the conversation. DO NOT mention anything related to the image here.

Palbot_reply: Generate a new response based on the user's reply and previous conversations. The tone should be humorous and friendly. Ensure the response is relevant, specific, and consistent with the user's personal information. DO NOT add quotes or backslashes in the generated reply. DO NOT mention anything related to the image here. NO more than 2 sentences.

Action: You can select an action to perform when the reply is finished based on the generated reply. Pay attention to the names of the available skills. Pay special attention to the coordinates or direction of any action that needs them. You should also pay attention to the following action rules:
    1. You should output actions in Python code format and specify any necessary parameters to execute that action. Only use function names and argument names exactly as shown in the skill library of valid actions. If a function has parameters, you should also include their names and decide their values, like 'turn_right("small")'. If an action does not have a parameter, just output the action function call, like "go_back()".
    2. Given the current reply and Previous_conversations_summary, you should only choose the most suitable action from the skill library. You cannot use actions that are not in the skill library. DO NOT choose speak().

You should only respond in the format described below and not output comments or other information. DO NOT change the title of each item.
