Your Overall Task is:
<$task_description$>

Subtask description:
<$subtask_description$>

Image introduction:
<$image_introduction$>

Image_Description: Using the latest image, please describe it in detail. Pay attention to any details in the image, such as people's emotions, objects on their desks.

Target_name: Please detect  the most relevant object, image area for completing the current task, if needed. What item should be detected to complete the task based on the latest image and the current task? You should obey the following rules:
1. Identify an item or area that is relevant to the current or intermediate target of the task.
2. For the target object, consider its possible forms and list as many as possible.
3. If there is a new possible target object, compare it with the current one and choose the one that is the most promising.
4. If no explicit item is specified, only output "null".
5. If there is no need to detect a target, only output "null".

Reasoning_for_target: Why was this target chosen, or why is there no need to detect or use a new target? Why is this target more promising than other possible targets?

You should only respond in the format described below and not output comments or other information. DO NOT change the title of each item.
